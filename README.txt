Open eHealth Integration Platform (IPF)  
---------------------------------------

The Open eHealth Integration Platform (IPF) is a stable, production-ready 
integration platform with special support for the eHealth domain. It supports 
several deployment options ranging from light-weight embedded deployments in 
consumer or provider processes, standalone single-node or clustered deployments 
up to deployments inside ESBs like Apache ServiceMix or OpenESB. 

IPF is based on the Apache Camel routing and mediation engine that supports the 
development of integration solutions from Enterprise Integration Patterns. 
Apache Camel provides a domain-specific language (DSL) for implementing 
integration solutions. Inside IPF applications you can use Camel's DSL together 
with IPF's DSL extensions for implementing integration solutions for the eHealth
domain. The DSL extensions provided by IPF are based on the Groovy programming
language. IPF applications are typically written in Groovy but many of the IPF
features are also available for Java applications. Usage of IPF is not limited 
to the eHealth domain. It can be used for general-purpose message processing as
well. For example, IPF defines further DSL extensions to make Groovy's XML 
processing features available to IPF applications. Also, Groovy closures are an 
integral part of the DSL. A detailed description of these and many other 
features is given in the IPF reference manual.
